This project is for building a comparative analysis of statistical modeling against deep learning algorithms in cryptocurrency signal prediction through a broad market directional filter.


This repository contains code for a systematic methodology to perform short-term forecasting of cryptocurrency prices using LSTM and AR models, supplemented by a bidirectional broad market filter. The goal is to provide accurate predictions for three major cryptocurrencies: EthUSD, BitcoinUSD, and BitcoinEtherum, based on historical price data obtained from the Binance exchange at a 15-minute interval.
